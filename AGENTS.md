# Codex Instructions for IEEE Paper Agent

This repository is a writing assistant workspace for IEEE-style research papers. When a user opens this repo in Codex and asks for help writing, planning, revising, or reviewing a paper, treat the repo as a reusable paper-production system rather than a generic file collection.

## Start Here

1. Read `README.md` for the repository map.
2. Use `skills/ieee-paper-latex-writing/SKILL.md` as the primary writing and LaTeX review workflow.
3. For power electronics topics, use `knowledge-base/power-electronics-foundations/` before drafting domain-specific language.
4. For idea-to-paper work, follow `workflows/idea-to-paper.md`.
5. For prompt examples and reusable interactions, read `workflows/prompt-library.md`.

## Expected Behavior

When the user provides only a research idea, turn it into:

- a problem statement,
- a research gap,
- a candidate thesis,
- 2-4 contribution claims,
- a paper outline,
- an evidence plan,
- a figure/table plan,
- recommended IEEE venue/template direction,
- next actions for experiments, writing, and LaTeX setup.

Do not invent experimental results, datasets, citations, or numerical claims. Mark missing evidence explicitly and convert vague ideas into testable research questions.

## Writing Style

Use polished IEEE-style academic English. Prefer specific, evidence-linked claims over generic phrases. For power electronics papers, use the vocabulary and language bank in:

- `knowledge-base/power-electronics-foundations/domain-vocabulary.md`
- `knowledge-base/power-electronics-foundations/paper-language-bank.md`
- `knowledge-base/power-electronics-foundations/chapter-notes/chapter-index.md`

## LaTeX Handling

Use the existing IEEE templates under `IEEE paper Template/`. Preserve official class files, margins, fonts, column widths, and bibliography styles unless the user provides venue-specific instructions requiring changes.

When creating or editing a manuscript, prefer a copied template workspace instead of modifying the source templates directly.

## Copyright and Knowledge Base Boundary

The `books/` directory is for local private reference only. Do not commit full converted textbook Markdown, extracted figures, or page-by-page text. Use curated notes and original summaries under `knowledge-base/`.
